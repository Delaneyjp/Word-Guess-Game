# Word-Guess-Game

I call this game "Hollywood Hangman"

Press Any Key to Start Game. 
Then press the keyboard to guess a letter. 
Each  Game will be a Title of a Famous Movie.

This was made with JavaScript & jQuery. 
I am a beginner, so a few of the ideas that I planned, I was unable to complete before the due date such as;
   - Blinking Instructions to Press Any Key
   - A section that included a short Hint that appeared for each title. 
   - A short movie clip at the end of each game in pop up window over word. 
   
...Maybe next time. 

*I hope you enjoy!!!*
